  $results = sigma_clip(
      center      => Optional [ Center | CodeRef ],
      clip        => Optional [PositiveNum],
      coords      => Optional [Coords],

Center a dataset by iteratively excluding data outside of a radius
equal to a specified number of standard deviations. The dataset may be
specified as a list of coordinates and optional weights, or as a
weight piddle of shape I<NxM> (e.g., an image).  If only the weight
piddle is provided, it is converted internally into a list of
coordinates with associated weights.

To operate on a subset of the input data, specify the C<mask> option.

A L<PDL::Algorithm::Center::Failure::parameter> exception will be
thrown if there is a parameter error.

The center of a data set is determined by:

=over

=item 1

clipping (ignoring) the data whose distance to the current center is
greater than a specified number of standard deviations

=item 2

calculating a new center by performing a (weighted) centroid of the
remaining data

=item 3

calculating the standard deviation of the distance from the remaining
data to the center

=item 4

repeat step 1 until either a convergence tolerance has been met or
the iteration limit has been exceeded

=back

The initial center may be explicitly specified,  or may be calculated
by performing a (weighted) centroid of the data.

The initial standard deviation is calculated using the initial center and either
the entire dataset, or from a clipped region about the initial center.

=head3 Options

The following options are available:

=over

=item C<center> => I<ArrayRef | Piddle1D_ne | coderef >

The initial center.  It may be

=over

=item *

An array of length I<N>

The array may contain undefined values for each dimension for which the center should
be determined by finding the mean of the values in that dimension.

=item *

A piddle with shape I<N>  (or
something that can be coerced into one, see L</TYPES>),

=item *

A coderef which will return the center as a piddle with shape I<N>.
The subroutine is called as

  &$center( $coords, $mask, $weight, $total_weight );

with

=over

=item C<$coords>

A piddle with shape I<NxM> containing I<M> coordinates with dimension I<N>

=item C<$mask>

A piddle with shape I<M>, essentially a flattened copy of the initial C<$mask> option to L</iterate>.

=item C<$weight>

A piddle with shape I<M>, essentially a copy of the initial C<$weight> option to L</iterate>.

=item C<$total_weight>

A scalar which is the sum of  C<$mask * $weight>

=back

=back

=item C<clip> => I<positive number>

I<Optional>.  The clipping radius used to determine the initial standard deviation.

=item C<coords> => I<Coords>

I<Optional>.  The coordinates to center.  C<coords> is a piddle of
shape I<NxM> (or anything which can be coerced into it, see
L</TYPES>) where I<N> is the number of dimensions in the data and
I<M> is the number of data elements.

C<weight> may be specified with coords to indicate weighted data.

C<mask> may be specified to indicate that a subset of the coordinates
should be operated on.

C<coords> is useful if the data cube is not fully populated; for dense
data, use C<weight> I<instead>.

=item C<dtol> => I<positive number>

I<Optional>.  If specified iteration will cease when successive centers are closer
than the specified distance.

=item C<iterlim> => I<positive integer>

I<Optional>. The maximum number of iterations to run.  Defaults to 10.

=item C<log> => I<boolean|coderef>

I<Optional>.

If C<log> is true (and not a I<coderef>), a default logger which outputs
to B<STDOUT> will be used.

If a I<coderef> it will be called before the first iteration and at
the end of each iteration. It is passed a copy of the current
iteration's results object; see L</Sigma Clip Iteration Results>.

=item C<mask> => I<piddle>

I<Optional>. This is a piddle which specifies which coordinates to include in
the calculations. Its values are either C<0> or C<1>, where values of C<1>
indicate coordinates to be included.  It defaults to a piddle of all C<1>'s.

When used with C<coords>, C<mask> must be a piddle of shape I<M>,
where I<M> is the number of data elements in C<coords>.

If C<coords> is not specified, C<mask> should have the same shape as
C<weight>.

=item C<save_mask> => I<boolean>

If true, the mask used in the final iteration will be returned
in the iteration result object.

=item C<save_weight> => I<boolean>

If true, the weights used in the final iteration will be returned
in the iteration result object.

=item C<nsigma> => I<scalar>

The size of the clipping radius, in units of the standard deviation.

=item C<weight> => I<piddle>

I<Optional>. Data weights. When used with C<coords>, C<weight> must be
a piddle of shape I<M>, where I<M> is the number of data elements in
C<coords>. If C<coords> is not specified, C<weight> is a piddle of
shape I<NxM>, where I<N> is the number of dimensions in the data and
I<M> is the number of data elements.

It defaults to a piddle of all C<1>'s.

=back

=head3 Sigma Clip Results

from the final iteration object (See L</Sigma Clip Iterations> ), with
the following additional attributes/methods:

=over

=item C<iterations> => I<arrayref>

An array of results objects for each iteration.

=item C<success> => I<boolean>

True if the iteration converged, false otherwise.

=item C<error> => I<error object>

If convergence has failed, this will contain an error object
describing the failure.  See L</Errors>.

=item C<mask> => I<piddle>

If the C<$save_mask> option is true, this will be the final
inclusion mask.

=item C<weight> => I<piddle>

If the C<$save_weight> option is true, this will be the final
weights.

=back

=head4 Sigma Clip Iterations

The results for each iteration are stored in an object with the
following attributes/methods:

=over

=item C<center> => I<piddle|undef>

A 1D piddle containing the derived center.  The value for the last
iteration will be undefined if all of the elements have been clipped.

=item C<iter> => I<integer>

The iteration index.  An index of C<0> indicates the values determined
before the iterative loop was entered, and reflects the initial
clipping and mask exclusion.

=item C<nelem> => I<integer>

The number of data elements used in the center.

=item C<total_weight> => I<number>

The combined weight of the data elements used to determine the center.

The standard deviation of the clipped data.  The value for the last
iteration will be undefined if all of the elements have been clipped.

=item C<clip> => I<number|undef>

The clipping radius.  This will be undefined for the first iteration
if the C<clip> option was not specified.

=item C<dist> => I<number>

I<Optional>. The distance between the previous and current centers. This is defined
only if the C<dtol> option was passed.

A reference to a L<Hash::Wrap> based object containing data for the
current iteration, with attributes as described above for C<$last>

=item C<$work>

A hashref which  may use to store temporary data (e.g. work
piddles) which will be available to all of the callback routines.

=back

The C<is_converged> routine is passed references to the B<actual>
objects used by B<sigma_clip> to keep track of the iterations.  This
means that the C<is_converged> routine may manipulate the starting
point for the next iteration by altering its C<$current> parameter.

C<is_converged> is called prior to entering the iteration loop with
C<$last> set to C<undef>.  This allows priming the C<$current> structure,
which will be used as C<$last> in the first iteration.

=item C<coords> => I<Coords>

The coordinates to center.  C<coords> is a piddle of
shape I<NxM> (or anything which can be coerced into it, see
L</TYPES>) where I<N> is the number of dimensions in the data and
I<M> is the number of data elements.

=item C<iterlim>

A positive integer specifying the maximum number of iterations.

=item C<log> => I<coderef>

I<Optional>. A subroutine which will be called

=over

=item between the call to C<initialize> and the start of the first iteration

=item at the end of each iteration

=back

It is invoked as

  &$log( $iteration );

where C<$iteration> is a I<copy> of the current iteration object.  The object will
have at least the following fields:

=over

=item C<center> => I<piddle|undef>

A piddle of shape I<N> containing the derived center.  The value for
the last iteration will be undefined if all of the elements have been
clipped.

=item C<iter>

The iteration index

=item C<nelem>

The number of included coordinates.

=item C<total_weight>

The summed weight of the included coordinates.

=back

There may be other attributes added by the various callbacks
(C<calc_wmask>, C<calc_center>, C<is_converged>). See for example,
L</Sigma Clip Iterations>.

=item C<mask> => I<piddle>

I<Optional>. This is a piddle which specifies which coordinates to include in
the calculations. Its values are either C<0> or C<1>, where values of C<1>
indicate coordinates to be included.  It defaults to a piddle of all C<1>'s.

When used with C<coords>, C<mask> must be a piddle of shape I<M>,
where I<M> is the number of data elements in C<coords>.

If C<coords> is not specified, C<mask> should have the same shape as
C<weight>.

=item C<save_mask> => I<boolean>

If true, the mask used in the final iteration will be returned
in the iteration result object.

=item C<save_weight> => I<boolean>

If true, the weights used in the final iteration will be returned
in the iteration result object.

=item C<weight> => I<piddle>

I<Optional>. Data weights.  When used with C<coords>, C<weight> must
be a piddle of shape I<M>, where I<M> is the number of data elements
in C<coords>. If C<coords> is not specified, C<weight> is a piddle of
shape I<NxM>, where I<N> is the number of dimensions in the data and
I<M> is the number of data elements.

It defaults to a piddle of all C<1>'s.

=back

Callbacks are provided with L<Hash::Wrap> based objects which contain
the data for the current iteration.  They should add data to the
objects underlying hash which records particulars about their specific
operation,

=head3 Work Space

Callbacks are passed L<Hash::Wrap> based iteration objects and a
reference to a C<$work> hash.  The iteration objects may have additional
elements added to them (which will be available to the caller),
but should refrain from storing unnecessary data there, as each
new iteration's object is I<copied> from that for the previous iteration.

Instead, use the passed C<$work> hash.  It is shared amongst the
callbacks, so use it to store data which will not be returned to
the caller.

=head3 Results

B<iterate> returns an object which includes all of the attributes
from the final iteration object (See L</Iteration Object> ), with
the following additional attributes/methods:

=over

=item C<iterations> => I<arrayref>

An array of result objects for each iteration.

=item C<success> => I<boolean>

True if the iteration converged, false otherwise.

=item C<error> => I<error object>

If convergence has failed, this will contain an error object
describing the failure.  See L</Errors>.

=item C<mask> => I<piddle>

If the C<$save_mask> option is true, this will be the final
inclusion mask.

=item C<weight> => I<piddle>

If the C<$save_weight> option is true, this will be the final
weights.

=back

The value of the C<center> attribute in the last iteration will be
undefined if all of the elements have been clipped.

=head4 Iteration Object

The results for each iteration are stored in an object with the
following attributes/methods (in addition to those added by the
callbacks).

=over

=item C<center> => I<piddle|undef>

A 1D piddle containing the derived center.  The value for the last
iteration will be undefined if all of the elements have been clipped.

=item C<iter> => I<integer>

The iteration index.  An index of C<0> indicates the values determined
before the iterative loop was entered, and reflects the initial
clipping and mask exclusion.

=item C<nelem> => I<integer>

The number of data elements used in the center.

=item C<total_weight> => I<number>

The combined weight of the data elements used to determine the center.

=back

=head3 Iteration Steps

Before the first iteration:

=over

=item 1

Extract an initial center from C<center>.

=item 2

Create a new iteration object.

=item 3

Call C<initialize>.

=item 4

Call C<log>

=back

For each iteration:

=over

=item 1

Creat a new iteration object by B<copying> the old one.

=item 2

Call C<calc_wmask>, with a copy of the initial mask and weights. C<calc_mask>
should update (in place) at least one of them

=item 3

Update summed weight and number of elements if C<calc_wmask> sets them to C<undef>.

=item 4

Call C<calc_center> with the current mask and weights.

=item 5

Call C<is_converged> with the current mask and weights.

=item 6

Call C<log>

=item 7

Goto step 1 if not converged and iteration limit has not been reached.

=back
