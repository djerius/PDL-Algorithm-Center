  [API BREAKAGE]

    * inclusion masks and weights are now treated as separate
      objects; all callbacks must treat them as such and are
      passed both.

    * iteration results attribute weight is now total_weight
      to differentiate it from the weight piddle

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * iterate/sigma_clip: save_mask, save_weight options return
      mask/weight used in last iteration.

    * sigma_clip: a default logger is provided

  [BUG FIX]

    * sigma_clip: insure there's an "iter" attribute
      in the first Iteration object

    * sigma_clip callbacks now throw on divide-by-zero errors

    * iterate catches the initialize callbacks's errors and
      returns them via the result->error attribute

0.04      2017-10-25 14:54:41-04:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]
